    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span class="highlight">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an <span class="highlight">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 
        24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span class="highlight">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>  <br><br>
        The <span class="highlight"> Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="highlight">Engineering and 
            Vocational Education (PTK)</span>  department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. 
        PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span class="highlight">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs. </span> So, it would be better 
        if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="highlight">Building Engineering Education,</span>  and <span class="highlight">Mechanical Engineering Education.</span>  
        To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of 
        information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="highlight">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span> </p>
